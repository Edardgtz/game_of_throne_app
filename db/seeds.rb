# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# characters = GameOfThronesApi.get_characters
# character_names = []
# characters.each do |character|
#   if character["tvSeries"][0] != ""
#     character_names << character["name"]
#   end
# end

# character_names.each do |name|
#   Character.create!(name: name, character_description: "")
# end
